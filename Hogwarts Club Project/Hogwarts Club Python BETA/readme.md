This is a deprecated version of the Hogwarts Club project that is based on a python/flask/sqlite3 backend.<br>
It is written in a completely chaotic and non conventional way, and I'm sincerely sorry about it.<br>
Since a lot of features are non functionnal/locked, almost 90% of the website isn't working.<br>
Of course, you will need to install the Flask python package to run this script.<br><br>

In the end, this version was only meant for testing the (non conventional) account log-in feature and the JavaScript API calls for showing various informations about the Hogwarts characters.<br>
Please do not try to modify any file.<br><b>

I'm planning to completely rewrite the project's files in a more readable and conventional way, in python/flask or node.js (according to the next coding weeks directives).
